# ADA API Caller

## Description
A Simple application that runs on your browser which retrieves data from the ADA API. Mostly used to familiarize with syntax for sending requests, but has the possibility for scaling to actually be useful.

## To run
1. Find your Bearer token and paste it into the bearerToken variable in App.js. 
2. Within the project directory, execute 'npm start' in the terminal.

## Things to do
- Get the 'forever' bearer token from Austin (or was it Jonathan?) so that we don't have to enter a new 
bearer token every day.
- Upload an image to the webpage and have it change every few seconds.
- Prompt the user at startup to enter a vehicle's vin, so that doesn't need to be hard-coded (right now it's just a default test vin)
- Make it so the old data get's erased when you submit a new request
- Make the displayed data easier to read and/or filter the results** (Andrew said this would be tricky)
- Add more request options
- Make it look cooler (style it)
- ?? anything!
